  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> September 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Scope of Services</h2>
  <p>
    Appealix provides <strong>administrative document preparation services only</strong>.
    Services may include rewriting appeal letters, completing insurance appeal forms
    based on client-provided information, and organizing appeal-related documents.
  </p>
  <p>
    Appealix does <strong>not</strong>:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide legal advice</li>
    <li>Provide medical advice</li>
    <li>Provide insurance advice</li>
    <li>Represent clients before insurance companies</li>
    <li>Submit appeals on behalf of clients</li>
    <li>Communicate with insurers as an authorized representative</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Clients remain solely responsible for reviewing, approving, and submitting all
    appeal materials.
  </p>

  <h2>2. No Professional Relationship</h2>
  <p>
    Use of Appealix services does not create an attorney-client relationship,
    doctor-patient relationship, or insurance representative relationship.
    All services are administrative in nature.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Client Responsibilities</h2>
  <p>By using our services, you agree that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>All information provided is accurate to the best of your knowledge</li>
    <li>You will not upload unredacted Social Security Numbers or highly sensitive personal identifiers</li>
    <li>You are responsible for redacting sensitive information prior to upload</li>
    <li>You will review all prepared documents before submitting them to your insurer</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Appealix is not responsible for errors or delays resulting from incomplete,
    inaccurate, or outdated client-provided information.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Fees and Payment</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Service fees are disclosed prior to payment</li>
    <li>Service selection is subject to intake review and confirmation</li>
    <li>Payment instructions are provided after intake review</li>
    <li>Work begins only after payment is received</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Fees are charged for administrative services rendered and are
    <strong>non-refundable once work has commenced</strong>, unless otherwise required by law.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Turnaround Times</h2>
  <p>
    Any turnaround times provided are estimates only and are not guarantees.
    Expedited services apply solely to administrative preparation timelines.
  </p>

  <h2>6. No Guarantee of Outcome</h2>
  <p>
    Appealix makes no guarantees regarding appeal approvals, reversals of insurance
    decisions, or insurer processing times. All appeal outcomes are determined
    exclusively by the insurance provider.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>
    To the maximum extent permitted by law, Appealix’s liability is limited to
    the amount paid for the specific service giving rise to the claim.
  </p>
  <p>
    Appealix is not liable for insurance determinations, missed deadlines not disclosed
    by the client, client failure to submit materials, or actions of third-party systems.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Data Handling</h2>
  <p>
    Client information is used solely for providing requested administrative services.
    Appealix does not sell or rent client data.
  </p>
  <p>
    Clients should not submit medical records or sensitive personal identifiers unless
    explicitly requested through secure instructions.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Governing Law</h2>
  <p>
    These Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which Appealix operates,
    without regard to conflict-of-law principles.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Acceptance</h2>
  <p>
    By submitting an intake form, selecting a service, or submitting payment, you
    acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to these Terms of Service.
